A Banking System made with Java

Objective:
Create a Java-based Banking System with a simple User Interface to enhance my skills in Swing, Object-Oriented Programming, and Basic Java Libraries.

Features:

Allows users to either create or sign in to an existing account.
Encrypts user passwords before storage in a JSON file.
Perform deposits, withdrawals, or check their current balance.
Simple, user-friendly Java Swing design.
Storing Data:
Using JSON Objects and JSON Arrays, I wrote user information to a JSON file and read it when necessary to access data.
